🌐 Deekshitha Puppala — Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, created to showcase my projects, skills, and growth as a frontend developer.

What began as a simple portfolio idea gradually became a hands-on learning journey involving UI design, animations, routing challenges, deployment issues, and real-world debugging. This project reflects not just what I built, but what I learned along the way.
